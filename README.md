Thesis

##
This is a web application with an image reader system built using python programming language.

'''This website application allows user to upload an image and it will automatically be embedded with a digital watermark
to protect the copyright ownership of the users' image/work.

'''The image reader system integrated/connected in the web application is the one responsible for the watermark embedding. 

'''This web application is not yet ready or open for actual usage as this is only made to present a possibilty of a web application
to have an image reader system to facilitate the embedding of an invisible and robust watermark.

'''We are also very open for collaboration to further improve the system and to make it become fully functional.
